        <h5 class="card-title"><strong>About us</strong></h5>
        <p class="card-text">My dad gave me the "gardening bug" when I was just a kid. He would always take me to the nursery with him and let me pick out my own plants to grow each year. After high school I worked for a landscaper for a few years and I have been pruning trees since I was 18.</p>
		  <p>A few years ago I was working in banking but spent my free time taking the Master Gardener Course from the USU Extension. After a few years I realized banking wasn't for me. So I decided to make a career change. While I was trying to decide the direction of my career, I started serving my neighbors by trimming their trees and helping them in their yards, and before I knew it I had a landscape company.</p>
		  <p>A few years ago my dad asked me to build him some garden boxes that were high enough to sit on while he worked in his garden. So my brother and I designed a garden box that met dad's needs and that would last for years to come. After seeing the boxes we made for my dad, neighbors starting requesting boxes too. </p>
		  <p>We sold 67 garden boxes that first year and we have made over 3000 cedar garden boxes over the last 7 years since then. We have learned a lot about how to build a quality box, and over the years we have made small changes to make a better, longer lasting box.  SilverCreek started with just me and 2 garden boxes in my dads yard, and has grown to 700 boxes a year and a team of hard working people who love making yards look better.</p>
